## Week 2
We worked on HTML code, respecting its semantics and structure exclusively. We didn't care about its esthetic.

## Week 3
Now, we made the website look similar to Figma's view, creating CSS code to modify the Website presentation. We made focus on Position property.

## Week 4
We changed CSS week 3's code by the usage of flexbox and separated the CSS style code in different files called header.css, main.css, sidebar.css and footer.css. Also, my GitHub page is: https://tobiaspujol.github.io/BaSP-M2022-Etapa-1/Semana-04/index.html
